# Field inputs

The [Field Input](./FieldInput/) is the component that is used for any input field that has a cursor and that can subsequently be typed in. There are two subfamilies.

- [Text Inputs](./textInputs/) are fields with a single line of simple text. Think of integers, floats, units, floats with units, etcetera.
- [Resizing Inputs](./resizingInputs/) are fields that resize/grow depending on the input. Think of a mathematical expression or equation that can have nested fractions or similar.

See the respective folder for further documentation on the input field that you need.
