# Text inputs

Text inputs are input fields with just a single line of text. The field has a constant size. The [TextInput](./TextInput/) component extends the [FieldInput](../FieldInput/) component, and in turn there are various input fields that extend on the `TextInput`.

- [IntegerInput](./IntegerInput/) is for entering integer numbers.
- [FloatInput](./FloatInput/) is for floating point numbers, like 1.3 or 2.0*10^5.
- [UnitInput](./UnitInput/) is for entering only a unit, like "kg*m/s^2".
- [FloatUnitInput](./FloatUnitInput/) is for entering a number with a unit, like "2.3 km". This input field is used by the large majority of the physics exercises.

See the respective input field to find further documentation.
