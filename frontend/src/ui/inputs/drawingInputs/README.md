# Drawing input fields

Drawing input fields are input fields built around a certain drawing or image, that users can then interact with. Currently, there is only one type: the [Drawing Input](./DrawingInput/) field. This field is extended to various other input fields, but this is done for specific applications, so these are not stored in this module. See the [Drawing Input](./DrawingInput/) folder to see how you can easily extend this element to make your own drawing inputs.
