# SVG Components

There is a variety of SVG components, also known as shapes. These can be included into any Drawing, rendering the required SVG code. Each of them has a variety of properties.

There is one important thing to keep in mind when providing parameters. Often a property like `center` has both a default variant (like `center`, in drawing coordinates) and a graphical variant (like `graphicalCenter`, in graphical coordinates). Often only the drawing coordinates are given. These are then transformed to graphical coordinates and used. But if _also_ the graphical coordinates are given, then these are added at the end. This is useful in case a graphical shift is needed, of a certain number of pixels.
