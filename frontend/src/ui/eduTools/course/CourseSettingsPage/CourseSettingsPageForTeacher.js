		<p>The course settings page for teachers is still under development...</p>
		<p>In the future, this will be where you can add teachers to the course, or remove yourself as teacher.</p>
		<p>Much later on, functionalities to adjust the set-up of the course (what will be taught and in which block) will also be added. This is however quite a bit more complicated, so is for the future.</p>
		<p>Do you have any wishes for functionalities here? Let me know! Then I'll make sure to implement them along the way.</p>
