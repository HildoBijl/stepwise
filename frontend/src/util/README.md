# Front-end utility functions

This is where we store utility functions that are useful only on the front-end. Note that this does not include components: those are in the [UI](../ui/) folder. It does include the following.

- [colors](./colors.js) contains functionalities processing colors, in various storage formats.
- [development](./development.js) has tools specifically related to the development. These functions are generally not applied in production.
- [dom](./dom.js) has tools for reading and manipulating the DOM. Think of processing events, finding the right DOM element, or working with page coordinates.
- [react](./react.js) has utility functions related to React. Think of extra custom hooks for a large variety of applications.
