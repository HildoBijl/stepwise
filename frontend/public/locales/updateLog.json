More generally, for any numbers <inline-math/> and <inline-math/> we have <block-math/> Since fractions are usually easier to work with than negative exponents, it is usually wise, when you encounter a negative exponent, to directly rewrite is as a fraction. However, there are cases where the opposite is beneficial too.</par><warning>The terminology here is sometimes a bit confusing. In the expression <inline-math/> it is the <term>exponent</term> that is negative. However, in basic speech people sometimes also call this a negative <term>power</term>. This is due to the ambiguous use of the word \"power\" which sometimes refers to the exponent and sometimes to the whole thing. So when we say a negative power, we usually don't mean a power that's negative like <inline-math/>, but we mean a power with a negative exponent like <inline-math/>.</warning>"
