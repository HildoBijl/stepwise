You'll always see on the screen exactly what you have at any point in time.</par><par>Obviously equations have various <term>constraints</term>. There may not be multiple equals-signs in there - just one - and the equals sign should also not be in the middle of a fraction or function or so. If whatever you enter does not meet these criteria, it's considered an invalid submission. You will get a friendly warning and your submission will not be sent. Only valid submissions are eventually checked for correctness.</par>",
    "evaluating": "<head>Evaluating expressions</head><par>Step-Wise makes use of an self-designed <term>Computer Algebra System</term> (CAS). This CAS checks exercises for correctness. It does this in an intelligent way. Some exercises want you to write a certain exact equation, but in other exercises it could be \"anything <term>equivalent</term> to some model solution\". The Step-Wise CAS then checks your answer for equivalency. Obviously it cannot figure out all possible ways of rewriting equations, but most ways in which equations can be equivalent are detected.</par>"
