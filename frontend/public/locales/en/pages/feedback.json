  "bugs": "<head>Found a bug?</head><par>When you encounter a bug (doesn't matter how small) then send an email to <a>{infoEmail}</a> (Hildo). I'll solve it right away for you, so that both you and others won't run into it again. If possible please add:</par><ul><li>Where you encountered the bug: which skill/exercise.</li><li>What you did right before the bug popped up.</li><li>If possible a screenshot of the red error message from the Developer's Tools console (F12).</li></ul>",
  "improvements": "<head>Got ideas for improvement?</head><par>Would you like to see a change or extension? Let me know, and if it's not too much work we'll set it up as soon as we can! Email your idea to <a>{infoEmail}</a> and tell us everything you would like to see.</par>",
  "plans": "<head>Existing plans</head><par>We are currently working on or planning to work on the following.</par><ul><li><strong>Translation:</strong> Step-Wise is being extended to English and German!</li><li><strong>Theory pages:</strong> Every skill will get a brief summary with theory about the subject, including the steps to take to solve an exercise.</li><li><strong>Attachments:</strong> In the attachment pages you can look up physical constants. This is especially useful since physical constants aren't as constant across the internet as their name would imply.</li><li><strong>More topics:</strong> Especially on the fields of fundamental mathematics and engineering mechanics (statics) further skills will be added.</li></ul><par>In which direction Step-Wise will be developed afterwards is something only time will tell. And you, through tips and suggestions!</par>"
