This is especially useful since physical constants aren't as constant across the internet as their name would imply.</h><j><k>More topics:</k> Especially on the fields of fundamental mathematics and engineering mechanics (statics) further skills will be added.</j></c><l>In which direction Step-Wise will be developed afterwards is something only time will tell.
