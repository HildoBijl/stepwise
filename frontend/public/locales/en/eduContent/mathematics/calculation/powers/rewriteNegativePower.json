  "theory": {
    "intro": "<par>We know that a power is a repeated multiplication: <inline-math/> can also <skill-link>be written</skill-link> as <inline-math/>. But what could <inline-math/> be?</par>",
    "idea": "<head>The meaning of a negative exponent</head><par>Let's do a thought experiment. Let's say we start with the number <inline-math/>, which we can write as <inline-math/>. If we multiply this by <inline-math/>, we get <inline-math/> which is <inline-math/>. And if we do so again, we get <inline-math/> which is <inline-math/>. Every time we multiply our number by the base <inline-math/>, the exponent increases by one!</par><par>Next, let's reverse this. We start with <inline-math/> and divide by <inline-math/>. When we do, a factor <inline-math/> cancels out and we are left with <inline-math/>. If we do this again, we get <inline-math/>. Once more gives <inline-math/>. Note that a number to the power of one is simply itself. And if we divide by two again, we get <inline-math/>. A number to the power of zero always equals one.</par><par>What if we continue this pattern? If we divide by two again, the exponent reduces further, and we have <inline-math/>. Dividing by two again turns this into <inline-math/>. Note that we have <skill-link>rewritten the fraction of fractions</skill-link>. Dividing by two again gives <inline-math/>. Based on this, we see a pattern on what a negative exponent actually means.</par>",
    "rule": "<head>The rule</head><par>We see that a negative power like <inline-math/> is exactly the same as a fraction <inline-math/>. More generally, for any numbers <inline-math/> and <inline-math/> we have <block-math/> Since fractions are usually easier to work with than negative exponents, it is usually wise, when you encounter a negative exponent, to directly rewrite is as a fraction. However, there are cases where the opposite is beneficial too.</par><warning>The terminology here is sometimes a bit confusing. In the number <inline-math/> it is the <term>exponent</term> that is negative. However, in basic speech people sometimes also call this a negative <term>power</term>. This is due to the ambiguous use of the word \"power\" which sometimes refers to the exponent and sometimes to the whole thing. So when we say a negative power, we usually don't mean a power that's negative like <inline-math/>, but we mean a power with a negative exponent like <inline-math/>.</warning>"
