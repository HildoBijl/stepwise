If you for instance have <inline-math/> then you will be able to reduce the sums within the fraction, simplify the fraction as much as possible, subsequently add all terms together and simplify the final result. For the example, the result would be <inline-math/>. This skill does not involve <skill-link>multiplying/dividing fractions</skill-link> or <skill-link>simplifying fractions within fractions</skill-link>.</par>"
