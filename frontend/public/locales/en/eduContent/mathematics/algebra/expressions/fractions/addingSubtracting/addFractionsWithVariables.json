The skill does not require the cancellation of potential polynomial fractions afterwards.</par>"

  "theory": {
    "intro": "<par>If we add two number fractions with unequal denominator, such as <inline-math/>, then we know how to do so: ensure the denominators are equal by rewriting the fractions (giving <inline-math/>) and then adding up the fractions to get <inline-math/>. But how does this work when variables are involved, like when rewriting <inline-math/>? The answer is: exactly the same. But there are a few things to pay attention to.</par>",
    "equalDenominator": "<head>Ensuring an equal denominator</head><par>We want to add/subtract two <term>unlike fractions</term> (fractions with unequal denominator), such as <block-math/> We know how to <skill-link>add two like fractions</skill-link> (with equal denominators), but this time our fractions do not have equal denominators. To still be able to add these two fractions, we first must force them to have the same denominator.</par><par>To do so, we take the left fraction and multiply both the numerator and the denominator by <inline-math/> (that is, the denominator of the other fraction). This turns <inline-math/> into <inline-math/>. Note that this is the same: we could even <skill-link>cancel the factor</skill-link> again to get back to where we started. Identically, we also take the right fraction, and multiply its numerator and denominator by <inline-math/> (the denominator of the first fraction). This turns <inline-math/> into <inline-math/>. Altogether, we may hence write <block-math/> And now we have two fractions with equal denominator!</par>",
    "addingFractions": "<head>Adding the two fractions</head><par>We now have two fractions with equal denominator. Before we add these up, it is wise to first <skill-link>expand all brackets</skill-link> inside the numerators. That makes the next step a bit easier. Doing so gives <block-math/> Note that we leave the denominator unchanged: expanding brackets there is of course allowed, but generally does not make things easier.</par><par>Now that we have two relatively easy fractions with equal denominator, we can <skill-link>add them up</skill-link> in the usual way, by pulling the numerators together.
