    "intro": "<par>If we add two number fractions with equal denominator, such as <inline-math/>, then we know how to do so: add up the numerators to get <inline-math/>. But how does this work when variables are involved, like when calculating <inline-math/>? The answer is: exactly the same. But there are a few things to pay attention to.</par>",
    "rule": "<head>Applying the rule</head><par>We want to add/subtract two fractions with variables, like <block-math/> Note that these two fractions have an equal denominator. As a result, they're called <term>like fractions</term>. (When the two fractions are not like fractions, they are harder to add up. This will be discussed in a <skill-link>follow-up skill</skill-link>. This current skill only deals with like fractions.)</par><par>To add/subtract two like fractions, the rule says to directly add/subtract the numerators, while keeping the denominator as it is. In general, it says that <block-math/> When applying this rule, and especially when subtracting, brackets are crucial. After all, the two fractions from the example can also be written as <block-math/> If we subsequently subtract the numerators, while keeping the same denominator, we get <block-math/> According to the rule, this is what the two subtracted fractions are equal to. Note: the left set of brackets is not needed, but the brackets on the right are crucial. Without them the outcome would be something different.</par>",
    "simplifying": "<head>Simplifying the outcome</head><par>The above result is still unnecessarily long and can be simplified. The first step is to <skill-link>expand all brackets</skill-link> in the numerator. For the example, this results in <block-math/> Note that minus times minus becomes plus.</par><par>Subsequently, it is often possible to <skill-link>merge similar terms</skill-link> together. Note that <inline-math/> can be turned into <inline-math/> and similarly <inline-math/> can be turned into <inline-math/>. So we can write <block-math/> This cannot be simplified further, so we are done. Altogether, the final result can be written as <block-math/> In some cases there are further simplifications that can be done, like <skill-link>canceling fraction factors</skill-link>. For instance, if we for example would have gotten something like <inline-math/> in the end, then a factor <inline-math/> could have been canceled as well. However, for this skill these further simplifications are not required.</par>",
