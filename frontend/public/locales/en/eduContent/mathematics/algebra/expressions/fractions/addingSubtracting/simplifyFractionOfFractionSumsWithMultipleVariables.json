    "intro": "<par>Previously we looked into <skill-link>adding fractions</skill-link> (writing a sum of fractions as a single fraction) as well as <skill-link>dividing fractions</skill-link> (writing a fraction of fractions as a single fraction). This time we study a harder case. If we have a fraction that contains sums of fractions, like <inline-math/>, how do we turn this into a single fraction?</par>",
    "adding": "<head>Adding fractions</head><par>The first step is to add fractions where possible. In this case there is only one sum of fractions. To add them together, we first make sure they have equal denominator. This turns the original expression into <block-math/> Adding the fractions together then gives <block-math/> Now there are no additions/subtractions of fractions anymore.</par>",
    "simplifying": "<head>Simplifying fraction divisions</head><par>The second and final step is to simplify the division of fractions. First we use the default rules for dividing fractions to write it as a single fraction, <block-math/> The numbers in this fraction can still be simplified further. Specifically, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by <inline-math/> to get <block-math/> This is as simple as it gets. Of course the brackets could still be expanded, but it is a matter of preference whether that is actually \"simpler\" so this is optional here.</par>",
