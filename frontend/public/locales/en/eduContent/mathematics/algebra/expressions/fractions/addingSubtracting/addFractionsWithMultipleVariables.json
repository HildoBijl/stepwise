This includes <skill-link>multiplying both sides of a fraction by a factor</skill-link> to get an equal denominator and subsequently <skill-link>adding together the two like fractions</skill-link>. You also learn the opposite: splitting the fraction again, like turning <inline-math/> into <inline-math/>. This includes <skill-link>splitting the like fraction</skill-link> and subsequently <skill-link>simplifying the resulting fractions</skill-link>. The skill does not include <skill-link>expanding brackets</skill-link> or dealing with <skill-link>fractions inside of fractions</skill-link>.</par>"
