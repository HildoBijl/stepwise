For instance when seeing <inline-math/> you should immediately realize that <inline-math/> and <inline-math/> are identical, except for the constant factor in front. So these terms can be pulled together into <inline-math/>, resulting in a full expression <inline-math/>. This skill also includes dealing with negative factors like in <inline-math/>.</par>"
