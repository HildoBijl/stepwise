And what if there are also numbers and other factors involved, like in <inline-math/>? The key is to still cancel factors, but do so for numbers and variable factors separately.</par>",
    "rule": "<head>The rule</head><par>The whole process above can be done more quickly if we turn it into a rule. Effectively, we are canceling factors in the numerator and the denominator, reducing their exponents, until one of them disappears. From this idea, we can find the <term>general rule</term> <block-math/> Here <inline-math/> and <inline-math/> can be any numbers. The first outcome is used if <inline-math/>, while the second is used if <inline-math/>.

    "twoParts": "<head>Two parts</head><par>Now consider a more complex fraction like <inline-math/>. This time there are also numbers and other factors. The first thing we can do is focus on all the <term>numeric factors</term>. Since the order of multiplication does not matter, we can pull these factors to the front and write it as <block-math/> We can then <skill-link>simplify this numeric fraction</skill-link> to <inline-math/> This turns the full fraction into <block-math/> The numeric parts cannot be simplified further.</par><par>The second part is to focus on the <term>variable factors</term>. There are powers of <inline-math/> in both the numerator and the denominator. We could take the long way of <skill-link>rewriting powers</skill-link> and <skill-link>canceling fraction factors</skill-link> to write <block-math/> Or alternatively we can use our newfound rule and directly remove three factors of <inline-math/> from the numerator and the denominator. (The factor <inline-math/> simply stays as it is.) This immediately results in <block-math/> Having reduced the variable factors too, this is as simple as it can be written.</par>",
    "idea": "<head>The idea</head><par>First let's consider a fraction with powers, like <inline-math/>. To simplify this, the key is to see that a power <inline-math/> can be <skill-link>rewritten as a multiplication</skill-link> <inline-math/> and similarly for <inline-math/>. This turns the whole fraction into <block-math/> Once we have written it like this, we can <skill-link>cancel fraction factors</skill-link>. We can remove three <inline-math/>'es both above, in the numerator, and below, in the denominator. Above we are left with <inline-math/>, while below we remain with no factors of <inline-math/>, which comes down to <inline-math/>. So we have <block-math/> Note that at the end we have merged multiplications of repeated factors back into powers, turning <inline-math/> into <inline-math/>. This is as simple as we can write it.</par>"
