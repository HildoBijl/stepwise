This includes understanding the idea behind this: <skill-link>multiplying both sides of an equation by a factor</skill-link> and subsequently <skill-link>expanding brackets</skill-link> and <skill-link>simplifying any resulting fractions</skill-link>.

  "theory": {
    "intro": "<par>An equation often consists of multiple terms. The equation <inline-math/> for instance has two terms on the left and one term on the right. When rewriting such an equation, a common thing to do is <term>multiply all terms</term> by a factor, or alternatively <term>divide all terms</term> by a factor. We take a look at how and why this works, as well as what short-cuts we can take while doing so.</par>",
    "multiplying": "<head>Multiply all terms</head><par>When we have an equation like <inline-math/>, one thing we are allowed to do is <skill-link>multiply both sides of the equation</skill-link> by a factor. If we multiply by <inline-math/>, then we get <block-math/> Note that, when multiplying an entire side of the equation, we need to use brackets. Generally we don't want to have those brackets, and we can get rid of them by <skill-link>expanding them</skill-link>. This turns the equation into <block-math/> Finally we can simplify each individual term. On the left, we can <skill-link>simplify the fraction</skill-link>, while on the right the multiplication can be written more succinctly using a <skill-link>square</skill-link>. We end up with <block-math/> Look at how this resulted from the original equation <inline-math/>. Effectively, we have multiplied each term individually by <inline-math/>.</par>",
    "dividing": "<head>Divide all terms</head><par>We can do the same in reverse. After all, if we have an equation like <inline-math/>, we are also allowed to <skill-link>divide both sides of the equation</skill-link> by a factor. Dividing by <inline-math/> gives <block-math/> The fraction on the left can subsequently be <skill-link>split up into separate fractions</skill-link> through <block-math/> Finally we can <skill-link>simplify fractions</skill-link> to get back to <block-math/> Again look at how this follows from the starting point <inline-math/>. Effectively we have divided each term by <inline-math/>.</par>",
    "steps": "<head>The steps</head><par>To multiply or divide all terms in an equation by a factor, like when multiplying <inline-math/> by <inline-math/>, take the following steps.</par><list><item><a><skill-link>Apply the multiplication/division</skill-link> to the full equation. This turns the example into <inline-math/>.</a></item><item><b>On a multiplication <skill-link>expand the brackets</skill-link>, or on a division <skill-link>split up the fraction</skill-link>. For the example, we get <inline-math/>.</b></item><item><c>Simplify the resulting outcome, which usually comes down to <skill-link>simplifying various fractions</skill-link>, canceling terms where needed. This reduces the example to <inline-math/>.</c></item></list>",
    "shortCut": "<head>The short-cut</head><par>We can summarize the above ideas into a useful short-cut. If we want to multiply or divide an entire equation by a factor, we can directly apply that multiplication/division to each individual term, simplifying these terms as we go. So if we multiply the equation <inline-math/> by the factor <inline-math/>, we can immediately see that this turns into <inline-math/>. And if we then divide this by <inline-math/> again, we right away get back to <inline-math/>.</par>"
