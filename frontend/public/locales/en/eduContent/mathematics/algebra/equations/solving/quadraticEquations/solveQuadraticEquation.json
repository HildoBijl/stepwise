    "intro": "<par>A <term>quadratic equation</term> is an equation of the form <inline-math/>: it is a summation of a term with <inline-math/>, a term with <inline-math/> and a constant, without the presence of any higher powers of <inline-math/> or any roots or similar. This type of equation can be solved by following a few fixed steps. Even if you don't understand why these steps work, following the procedure will get you to the right solutions.</par>",
    "theTwoSolutions": "<head>The two solutions</head><par>To make the quadratic equation more intuitive, it helps to draw a graph of the expression on the left-hand side of the equation. If we for instance plot <inline-math/> we get the following graph.</par><quadratic-plot/><par>To solve the equation <inline-math/> we need to find the values of <inline-math/> where the plotted line has height <inline-math/> and hence crosses the horizontal axis. We see that this occurs at <inline-math/> but also at <inline-math/>. In other words, there are two values of <inline-math/> that satisfy the equation. The equation has two solutions!</par>",
    "findingTheTwoSolutions": "<head>Finding the two solutions</head><par>Finding solutions with a graph is easy, but usually we don't take the effort to make a graph. To still find the right values, we use the general solution of the quadratic equation.</par><par>Before we can use this solution, we write the equation as<block-math/>That is, <inline-math/> is the number before <inline-math/>, <inline-math/> is the number before <inline-math/> and <inline-math/> is the constant term in the sum. So for our example, we have <inline-math/>, <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>. Note that, due to the minus sign, <inline-math/> is negative!</par><par>Once we have <inline-math/>, <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>, we can insert them into the general solution for quadratic equations. This solution (an equation you should memorize since you'll use it so often) is<block-math/>This important equation is known as the <term>quadratic formula</term> or colloquially also as the <term>abc-formula</term>. You don't need to understand why this is the solution, but you do need to be able to apply it. To use it, we insert the values of <inline-math/>, <inline-math/> and <inline-math/> into this solution. For our example we get<block-math/>This looks rather complicated, but we can simplify it. If we simplify the number multiplications, we reduce this to<block-math/>The square root becomes <inline-math/> which is <inline-math/>, so the final result then becomes<block-math/>Note that the solution has a plus/minus sign. We can insert either a plus or a minus in the place of this symbol, and each case gives us a different solution. With a minus sign we get <inline-math/> while with a plus we get <inline-math/>. So thanks to the plus/minus sign we have the two solutions we were looking for! The general solution works.</par>",

If we plot this, we get the following graph.</par><quadratic-plot/><par>Note that this is the same parabola, except it's been shifted upwards by <inline-math/>. Now it doesn't intersect with the <inline-math/>-axis anymore! There are hence no solutions. There isn't a single number <inline-math/> that exists for which <inline-math/>.</par><par>We can see numerically why this is the case. Note that <inline-math/> is always a positive number. After all, the square of a number is always positive. Similarly, <inline-math/> is always positive. The only term in <inline-math/> that may be negative is <inline-math/>. However, this term will never match up to <inline-math/>. As a result, the expression <inline-math/> can never be zero.</par><par>So what happens if we still try to apply our general solution? In this case we have <inline-math/>, <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>. Inserting this gives<block-math/>Simplifying this turns it into<block-math/>Note that we now have a square root of a negative number. This is a mathematical impossibility: we cannot take square roots of negative numbers. Because our general solution gives a mathematical impossibility, there are no solutions possible to our equation.</par><par>In short: if the square root within the solution contains a negative number (so <inline-math/>) then the quadratic equation has no solutions. </par>",
    "oneSolution": "<head>One solution</head><par>There is an edge case where the quadratic equation has one solution. Let's consider for instance the equation <inline-math/>.
