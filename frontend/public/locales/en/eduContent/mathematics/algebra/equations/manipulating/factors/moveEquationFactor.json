  "theory": {
    "intro": "<par>A <term>product equation</term> is an equation like <inline-math/> where both sides of the equation only have multiplications/divisions; no additions or subtractions. When we have such an equation, it is helpful to be able to <term>move factors</term> around in the equation. That's what this skill is about. We look at how we do this, and what short-cuts we can take.</par>",
    "removingMultiplications": "<head>Getting rid of a multiplication</head><par>One thing that we can do with the equation <inline-math/> is to get rid of the <term>multiplication factor</term> <inline-math/> on the left. To do so, we can first <skill-link>divide both sides of the equation</skill-link> by <inline-math/>. This gives <block-math/> Both sides of the equation can be simplified. On the left we can <skill-link>cancel fraction factors</skill-link> to get rid of the <inline-math/> on both sides of the fraction, leaving us with just <inline-math/>. We see that the <inline-math/> indeed disappears from the left side of the equation, as was our goal. On the right, we can <skill-link>simplify the fraction division</skill-link> to get <inline-math/> (or alternatively <inline-math/>). The final result is <block-math/> Note that we have moved the multiplication factor <inline-math/> from the left to the right, and when we did, it turned into a division factor.</par>",
    "removingDivisions": "<head>Getting rid of a division</head><par>We could've also done something different with the equation <inline-math/>, which is to get rid of the <term>division factor</term> <inline-math/> on the right. To do so, we can <skill-link>multiply both sides of the equation</skill-link> by <inline-math/>. This turns it into <block-math/> On the right, the division by <inline-math/> and the multiplication by <inline-math/> <skill-link>cancel out</skill-link>, so this side reduces to just <inline-math/>. The result can be rewritten as <block-math/> Note that we have moved the division factor <inline-math/> from the right to the left, where it turned into a multiplication factor.</par>",
    "shortCut": "<head>The short-cut</head><par>We can summarize the above ideas into a useful short-cut. If we move a factor (multiplication or division) from one side of the equation to the other, we should do the following.</par><list><item><a>If the factor is a multiplication factor (it's in the numerator of a fraction, or just in a multiplication) then on the other side it will appear as a division factor (in the denominator of a fraction). So <inline-math/> turns into <inline-math/>.</a></item><item><b>If the factor is a division factor (in the denominator of a fraction) then on the other side it will appear as a multiplication factor (in the numerator of a fraction, or just in a multiplication). So <inline-math/> turns into <inline-math/>.</b></item></list><par>Using this idea, we can also directly move factors around, without applying the in-between steps.</par>",
    "steps": "<head>The steps</head><par>To move a factor from one side of a product equation to the other, like when moving the factor <inline-math/> in the equation <inline-math/>, take the following steps.</par><list><item><a>If the factor is in a multiplication, <skill-link>divide both sides of the equation</skill-link> by the factor.
