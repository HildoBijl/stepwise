    "intro": "<par>Equations often have summations with various <term>terms</term>. For instance in <inline-math/> the left side has terms <inline-math/> and <inline-math/> while the right side has the term <inline-math/>. A common thing we can do with equations is <term>move terms</term> to the other side of the equation. We'll first study the idea of how we can do that, and then summarize this idea into a short-cut.</par>",
    "movingAnAddedTerm": "<head>Moving an added term</head><par>Suppose we have the equation <inline-math/> and (for whatever reason) we want to get rid of the term <inline-math/> on the left. To do so, the first step is to <skill-link>subtract <inline-math/> from both sides</skill-link>. We are allowed to do this because, when we add or subtract the same term from both sides of the equation, the equation still remains valid. In this way we get <block-math/> Subsequently, we can see that on the left side adding <inline-math/> and subsequently subtracting <inline-math/> has no effect. We can hence <skill-link>cancel these sum terms</skill-link> to get <block-math/> Note that, when we compare this to the original equation <inline-math/>, we have removed the term <inline-math/> from the left side, while keeping the equation valid. The result is that this term <inline-math/> has moved to the right side of the equation, and while it used to have a plus sign on the left, now it has a minus sign on the right.</par>",

In this case the procedure would have been nearly the same, but this time we have to add <inline-math/> to both sides. This gives <block-math/> On the left, we can <skill-link>cancel sum terms</skill-link> again, to end up at <block-math/> Note that we have once more moved the term <inline-math/> to the other side of the equation.
