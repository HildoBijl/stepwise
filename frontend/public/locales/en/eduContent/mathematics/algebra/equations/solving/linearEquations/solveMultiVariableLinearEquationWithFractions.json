  "theory": {
    "intro": "<par>Consider an equation like <inline-math/> where the target variable <inline-math/> is in the denominator of some fraction. Sometimes such an equation is a <term>linear equation in disguise</term>. Here we learn how to check that, and how to subsequently solve such equations.</par>",
    "solving": "<head>Solving the linear equation</head><par>We can now <skill-link>solve the linear equation</skill-link> in the standard way. Expanding brackets gives <block-math/> Bringing all terms with <inline-math/> to the left and all other terms to the right, we wind up with <block-math/> Pulling <inline-math/> out of brackets then reduces this to <block-math/> The final solution follows by dividing by the term between brackets, giving <block-math/> This is the solution of the equation.</par>",
    "cleaning": "<head>Cleaning up the equation</head><par>The first thing that we always do is clean up the equation. If there are any fractions inside of fractions, we first want to solve that, <skill-link>reducing it to a single fraction</skill-link>. For the example, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction on the left by <inline-math/> to get <block-math/> After this, we note that the target variable <inline-math/> is still in the denominator. We can solve this by <skill-link>multiplying all terms</skill-link> by <inline-math/>. Optionally, we can also multiply all terms by <inline-math/> to get rid of the fraction on the right. This results in <block-math/> We have ensured that there are no fractions anymore with <inline-math/> in the denominator, so we have sufficiently cleaned up the equation. Now we see that the equation is in fact linear in <inline-math/>. That is, there are no powers of <inline-math/> or similar. Only multiplications by constants and non-target variables (which can also be seen as constants).</par>",
    "checking": "<head>Checking the solution</head><par>It is still wise to check the solution. To do so, we insert the solution into the original equation. Doing so gets us <block-math/> Simplifying the innermost fraction turns this into <block-math/> Multiplying both sides of the outer fraction by <inline-math/> further reduces this to <block-math/> Finally getting rid of the brackets, canceling the <inline-math/> term and subsequently the <inline-math/> factor will reduce this to <block-math/> This equation obviously holds, which means that the solution we found is correct.</par>",
