		"intro": "<par>Let's consider a <term>product equation</term> (an equation only having multiplications/divisions) with multiple variables, like <inline-math/>. Often the goal is to solve this equation for one of the variables, for instance <inline-math/>. In this skill we look at how to do that.</par>",
		"whatIsSolving": "<head>Solving a multi-variable product equation</head><par>The idea of a multi-variable equation like <inline-math/> is that, even if we don't know the values of the variables <inline-math/>, <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>, we know that the equality in the equation must hold. There is some restriction on the variables: not just every combination is possible.</par><par>We can choose a variable in this equation, like <inline-math/>, and solve the equation for this variable. We call this 'chosen variable' the <term>target variable</term>. To solve for the target variable, we must rewrite the equation (obviously in ways that still keep it valid) until it has the form <inline-math/>, where the dots do <emp>not</emp> contain the target variable <inline-math/>. They may (and will) depend on the other variables.</par>",
		"idea": "<head>Isolating the target variable</head><par>The procedure to isolate the target variable <inline-math/> is exactly the same as when we have a <skill-link>product equation with one variable</skill-link>. First we want to prevent <inline-math/> from being in any denominator of a fraction. We can remove it by <skill-link>moving <inline-math/> to the other side</skill-link>. This gives us <block-math/> Note that <inline-math/> is not in any denominator anymore.</par><par>To subsequently isolate <inline-math/>, we move <emp>all</emp> factors except for <inline-math/> to the other side. For the example, we move the <inline-math/> to the right to get <block-math/> We have isolated <inline-math/>!</par>",
		"afterwards": "<head>After finding the solution</head><par>As usual, we do not just want any solution, but we want a solution that's written as simple as possible. <skill-link>Simplifying the fraction</skill-link> will result in <block-math/> Note that first we have written the fraction of a fraction as one fraction, and subsequently we wrote the multiplication of <inline-math/> with itself as <inline-math/>.</par><par>Now that we have a relatively simple solution, we must <skill-link>check this solution</skill-link>. To do so, we insert the solution <inline-math/> into the <emp>original</emp> equation <inline-math/>. This gives <block-math/> If we write the fraction of fractions as one fraction, we simplify this equation to <block-math/> By canceling out factors, the fraction on the right side reduces to <inline-math/>. The full equation then becomes <block-math/> This equation certainly holds for all possible values of <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>, which means that our solution for <inline-math/> indeed solves the equation for all possible values of <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>. The solution is correct!</par>",
