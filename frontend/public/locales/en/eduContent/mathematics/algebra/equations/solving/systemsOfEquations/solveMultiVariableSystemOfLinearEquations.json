  "theory": {
    "intro": "<par>Suppose that we have two equations, like <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>. We could define two target variables (like <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>) that we want to solve for, treating all other variables as constants. How would we find the solutions for <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>?</par>",
    "solving": "<head>Solving the system of equations</head><par>The procedure of solving a system of linear equations with multiple variables is actually identical to <skill-link>solving a system of linear equations</skill-link> where there are only two variables. (So without any non-target variables.) First we pick one equation and <skill-link>solve it</skill-link> for one target variable. Solving the first equation for <inline-math/> would for instance give <block-math/> This solution is then <skill-link>inserted</skill-link> into the <emp>other</emp> equation. This results in <block-math/> This is a linear equation which can be <skill-link>solved</skill-link> for <inline-math/>. Multiplying all terms by <inline-math/> and expanding brackets gives us <block-math/> The solution for <inline-math/> follows as <block-math/> Now that <inline-math/> is solved, we can <skill-link>insert</skill-link> this into the solution we found earlier for <inline-math/>. This gives us <block-math/> This is a valid solution, but it contains a fraction within a fraction which is undesirable and should be <skill-link>simplified</skill-link>. Taking the respective steps, we end up with <block-math/> This is as simple as we can write the solution. Now that we have solutions for <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>, we have solved the system of equations.</par>",
    "checking": "<head>Checking the solution</head><par>After solving a system of equations, it's always worth while to check your solution, just to make sure you haven't made an error along the way. To do so, we <skill-link>insert</skill-link> both solutions into both equations. This gives us <math-list/> The solution is correct if both equations always hold. To see if this is the case, we must simplify the equations. Note that all fractions have the same denominator, so we can merge the fractions together, giving <math-list/> Expanding brackets and canceling sum terms turns the above into <math-list/> We finally note that, in each of the fractions, we can pull a factor out of the brackets. This gives us <math-list/> Both these equations obviously hold for all values of <inline-math/>, <inline-math/> and <inline-math/>, since the fractions equal <inline-math/> and can hence be removed. As a result, we conclude that the solution we found is correct.</par><par>You may note that checking the solution is just as much work, or possibly even more, than finding the solution. As a result, as you gain more experience with this skill and learn to work thoroughly, you don't always check your results anymore. But in case of doubt, it is still a useful trick to have.</par>",
