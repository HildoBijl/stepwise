    "intro": "<par>A <term>product equation</term> is an equation with only multiplications and divisions, like <inline-math/>. When given such an equation, the usual goal is to solve it. This skill teaches you exactly how to do that.</par>",
    "whatIsSolving": "<head>Solving an equation</head><par>Every equation has an unknown, like for instance <inline-math/>. <term>Solving</term> an equation means we rewrite the equation (obviously in ways that still keep it valid) until it has the form <inline-math/>, where the dots do <emp>not</emp> contain the unknown <inline-math/>. That is, we <term>isolate</term> the unknown variable. How to do so depends on the type of equation, but for product equations this can be done in a few fixed steps.</par>",
    "idea": "<head>The idea</head><par>We want to isolate <inline-math/> for an equation like <inline-math/>. A first problem here is that <inline-math/> is currently in the denominator of a fraction, which makes it hard to isolate. To fix this, we can <skill-link>move <inline-math/> to the other side</skill-link>, which gets us <block-math/> Now <inline-math/> is not in the denominator anymore, which makes the process easier.</par><par>If <inline-math/> is not in any denominator, we can start isolating it. To do so, we move <emp>all</emp> factors except for <inline-math/> to the other side. For the example, we move the <inline-math/> to the right to get <block-math/> We have isolated <inline-math/>!</par>",
    "afterwards": "<head>After finding the solution</head><par>Technically the above solution is a valid solution for the equation. However, we are not done. Often the most simple solution is required, so we should still simplify this outcome. <skill-link>Simplifying the fraction</skill-link> will result in <block-math/> This is as simple as gets.</par><par>Once we have a simplified solution, a valuable last step is to <skill-link>check it</skill-link>: does it really solve the original equation? It's very easy to make a small error, and this allows you to detect whether or not you did. To check the solution <inline-math/>, we insert it into the <emp>original</emp> equation <inline-math/> and look at whether the equation is balanced. We get <block-math/> If we simplify the fraction on the right, we see that it reduces to <inline-math/>, which is also the left side of the equation. The two sides match, so the solution is correct!</par>",
