Here you can learn how the web-app is set up and freely play around with the main functionalities.</par><warning>Honestly, don't do this tutorial. This is the 21st century. Apps should be intuitive enough to not need a manual or tutorial, and Step-Wise certainly meets those requirements. Or if you really want to do the tutorial, just play around with the exercises and only check the theory in the unlikely case that you get stuck. Learn by doing.</warning>",

For instance (like for this skill) simply entering a number into a field.</par><par>For every skill we estimate the <term>likelihood</term> that you will do it correctly. We developed our own probability theory script for this, which takes into account lots of different factors. <check><on-true>For you it's simple: you can always see the success chance through the skill orb in the top right corner.
