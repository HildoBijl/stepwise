# Math utility functions

All utility functions related to basic mathematics are in this folder. These are grouped as follows.

- [primes](./primes.js) handles matters around prime numbers. Is something a prime number, can we get certain prime numbers or we can get the prime decomposition of a number?
- [divisors](./divisors.js) checks division properties, like the greatest common divisor and the smallest common multiple.
- [powers](./powers.js) concerns itself with powers, like is a number the square or a higher power of another number?
- [factorials](./factorials.js) is about anything related to the factorial n!. This includes binomials (a over b) as well.
- [distributions](./distributions.js) has functions with distrbutions. Think of for instance the Gaussian PDF function (the bell curve).
