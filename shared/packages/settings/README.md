# Step-Wise settings

This package defines a few site-wide settings. Settings are parameters that _can_ change but rarely do: like once a year or so, and always accompanied by a new deploy.

The settings fall in the following categories.

- *i18n*: The internationalization settings. Which languages appear on the website, what is the default language, and where do we store language files?
- *users*: Anything related to users. Think of what is the latest version of the privacy policy.
- *numbers*: Settings related to number displays. Like what decimal separator to use on the site. (This may later on be implemented as a user setting instead.)
