# Step-Wise skill tracking

Step-Wise uses a large skill tree. For each student, and for each skill in the tree, Step-Wise tracks the mastery level. This file discusses script-wise how this all works. For the mathematics behind skill tracking, there is a separate PDF file to read. 

ToDo: add the PDF file with the mathematics.
ToDo: expand the file below.

## Handling the coefficient array

- Coefficients
- EV, moments and such

## The skill level for a single skill

## Applying smoothing

- Time based
- Practice based

## Calculating the difficulty for an exercise

## Calculating the posterior level of a skill

- Add in prerequisites
- Add in linked groups

## The SkillData object (front-end)

## Updating a skill level: implementing observations

- A single skill
- Using a setup
