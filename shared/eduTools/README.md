# Step-Wise educational tools

This folder contains all tools related to education in general. So matters that are not necessarily content-related. (For content-related matters, see the [eduContents](../eduContents/) folder.)

There are two important subdirectories: skills and exercises. There is an important distinction between the two.

- A [skill](skills/) is a type of behavior that can be shown. For example "summation": a student can add up numbers.
- An [exercise](exercises/) is a small page/script to practice/show the mastery of said skill with. For example "Calculate `a + b`" with `a` and `b` randomly generated.

A skill generally has multiple exercises. (Okay, for the summation example one exercise would suffice.) Similarly, most exercises directly correspond to a single skill, but this is not the case for *all* exercises! There are exercises in which two completely different skills need to be combined to solve a problem. In that case, this exercise is a good way to practice applying either skill. The exercise will then be coupled to both skills.

For further information, check out the respective [skills](skills/) and [exercises](exercises/) folders.
