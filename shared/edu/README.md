# Step-Wise educational content

Within Step-Wise there is an important distinction between skills and exercises.

- A [skill](skills/) is a type of behavior that can be shown. For example "summation": a student can add up numbers.
- An [exercise](exercises/) is a small page/script to practice/show the mastery of said skill with. For example "Calculate a + b" with a and b randomly generated.

A skill generally has multiple exercises. (Okay, for the summation example one exercise would suffice.) Similarly, most exercises directly correspond to a single skill, but this is not the case for *all* exercises! There are exercises in which two completely different skills need to be combined to solve a problem. In that case, this exercise is a good way to practice applying either skill. The exercise will then be coupled to both skills.
