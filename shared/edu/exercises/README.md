# The Step-Wise exercise system

To practice skills on Step-Wise, the students do exercises. There are a couple of things that every exercise has in common, but there are also different types of exercises. Let's study the commonalities and the differences.

Note that we only look at the exercises from the server perspective here. This is the best place to start reading, but if you want to program your own exercises, also read about the [front-end issues](../../../frontend/src/ui/edu/exercises/) afterwards.
