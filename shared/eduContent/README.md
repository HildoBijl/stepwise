# Educational content

In the `eduContent` folder you find all educational content. This also includes a few tools that are only relevant for certain contents. (General tools are in the [eduTools](../eduTools/) folder.) In this shared `eduContent` folder, you mainly find files related to exercises.

Every exercise has a unique `exerciseId`. Correspondingly, there are two files.

- One file is in the `shared/eduContent` folder. This contains the shared exercise data needed by both the front-end and the API: the exercise logic.
- One file is in the `frontend/src/ui/eduContent` folder. This contains info on how to display/render the exercise.

Do you want to know more about how exercises are programmed? Then study a few examples, or read up more about it in the [eduTools/exercises](../eduTools/exercises/) folder.
